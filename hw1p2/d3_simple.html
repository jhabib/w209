    <h2>Interactive Chart using d3</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
        This chart shows the number of hours I "sleep" at night, and the number of cups of coffee I drink the next morning. Hours
        of "sleep", and cups of coffee are plotted on the y-axis, and the date is plotted on the x-axis. The red line represents
        the hours of "sleep" and the blue line represents the cups of coffee. You can see that the less "sleep" I have at night,
        the more coffee I drink in the morning. The more coffee I drink in the morning, the less I "sleep" the next night. It's
        a vicious circle.
        </p>
        <p>The blue dots show the hours of sleep, and the red dots show the cups of coffee.<br/>Blue dotted line shows average of sleep, and red dotted line shows average of coffee.</p>
    </div>

    <h3>Interactivity:</h3>

    <p>This graph provides two kinds of interactivity.</p>
    <p>1. Select a day from the dropdown menu to filter the data by day of week. Select "All" to reset.<br/>
        2. Hover mouse over the blue dots to increase size by number of hours. Hover mouse over the red dots to increase size by cups
                of coffee.</p>
